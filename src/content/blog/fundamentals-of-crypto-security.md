As both a long‑time cryptocurrency practitioner and the owner of this site, I’ve seen the full spectrum of outcomes—from disciplined custody that preserves capital to avoidable losses caused by sloppy operational practices. Security is not a single tool; it’s a stack of decisions and routines. This post distills the essentials I rely on.

## 1) Custody models: know what you’re actually buying

Before anything else, decide **who controls the private keys**:

- **Self‑custody:** You control the keys. Maximum sovereignty, maximum responsibility.
- **Qualified custodian:** A regulated entity controls keys on your behalf. Less control, more formal safeguards.
- **Exchange custody:** Convenient, but you’re effectively unsecured in a bankruptcy event.

My rule: **operating capital can live on exchanges, strategic capital should not.**

## 2) Key management: the core of security

Every security conversation eventually reduces to key management.

- **Hardware wallets** are the baseline for individuals and small funds.
- **Multisig** (e.g., 2‑of‑3) adds redundancy and reduces single‑point failure.
- **Shamir backups** are viable, but require a careful recovery plan.

I use hardware wallets for day‑to‑day vaulting and multisig for long‑term reserves. Keep recovery seeds offline, distributed, and tested.

## 3) Operational security (OpSec) is more important than tools

Great tools fail under poor discipline. Stick to these:

- **Dedicated devices** for signing transactions.
- **No browser extensions** or risky downloads on signing machines.
- **Physical security** for devices and backups.
- **Routine audits** of addresses, balances, and permissions.

I schedule quarterly “recovery drills” to ensure backups are valid and procedures are understood.

## 4) Smart‑contract risk: minimize assumptions

If your funds touch smart contracts, assume there’s non‑zero risk:

- Prefer audited protocols with long track records.
- Use limits and time‑based permissions.
- Avoid overly complex yield strategies.

I treat every contract interaction as a **credit exposure** and size it accordingly.

## 5) A simple, resilient security checklist

- Use a hardware wallet.
- Enable multisig for long‑term storage.
- Keep an offline, geographically distributed backup.
- Practice recovery drills.
- Separate “hot” and “cold” assets.

Security is a process. If you can’t clearly explain your custody stack to a non‑expert, simplify it.

If you want a deeper post on implementing multisig or designing a custody policy for teams, let me know and I’ll publish a practical walkthrough.
